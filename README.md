## Representation of an H2 tag
###### Representation of an H6 tag

*Italic* text and then **Bold** text
But what about ***Italic and Bold*** text (can be done with either asterisks or underscores)

Starting list 1
* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3
  * Item 3a
  * Item 2b
(uses asterisks to make)

Ordered list 1
1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
  1. Item 3a
  1. Item 3b
(Uses 1. to make)


Blockquotes can be done with > symbols
> like so

There is also inline code
'<addr>' for example which is done using the >< in the opposite order
                                                  
                                                  There is more stuff, but I prefer to end here
